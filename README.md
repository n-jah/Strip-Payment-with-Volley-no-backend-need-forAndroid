# PaymentTest

This project is a basic implementation of a payment flow using **Stripe** in an Android application. It allows users to initiate a payment by entering an amount, which is processed through the Stripe API. The project utilizes **Volley** for network requests and **Stripe Payment Sheet** for handling the payment UI.
## Screenshots

## Features

- **Create Customer**: Generates a new customer ID for each user.
- **Generate Ephemeral Key**: Creates an ephemeral key for the customer, used to authenticate the payment.
- **Payment Intent**: Creates a payment intent with the specified amount.
- **Stripe Payment Sheet**: Displays Stripe’s payment sheet to complete the transaction.
- **Error Handling**: Displays toast messages for common errors such as failed customer or payment intent creation.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**
- **Stripe Android SDK** for payment processing
- **Volley** for network requests
- **View Binding** for easy view references

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PaymentTest.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.

3. Enable View Binding in `build.gradle` (already done in this project):
   ```gradle
   viewBinding {
       enabled = true
   }
   ```

4. Add the required dependencies in `build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.stripe:stripe-android:20.6.0'
   implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.2.1'
   ```

5. Sync your project with Gradle files.

## Configuration

1. Go to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).
2. Obtain your **Secret Key** and **Publishable Key**.
3. Replace the keys in `MainActivity.kt`:
   ```kotlin
   private val SECRET_KEY = "sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   private val PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "pk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   ```

**Note**: Ensure that you keep your Secret Key secure. Never expose it in client-side code for production.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your device or emulator.
2. Enter an amount in the input field (e.g., 50 for $0.50).
3. Tap the **Pay** button.
4. The app will:
   - Create a customer and an ephemeral key.
   - Initiate a payment intent with the specified amount.
   - Display the Stripe Payment Sheet for completing the payment.
5. Complete the payment process in the Stripe Payment Sheet.
